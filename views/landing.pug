      //- LOOK AT THE BUTTON's FUNCTION. use `<javascript>` and '<pug variable>'

//- look at the condition: if leads mean if the webpage is rendering this page and puts a value into the key 'leads', then this condition is true and it
//- will render some things based on the command we have tasked it to do

//- on HTML/CSS/JS side: pug/JS are hierarchical in nature. if we delete the body corresponding to p(id=lead.id), we are effectively deleting all the
//-     child bodies that are nested inside of p body.
