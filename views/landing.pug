                //- we have built a container that has a row. this row has a column of medium-sized screen of 6
            form(action="/", method="POST")

        //- Notice that tr(id=lead.id) element is instantiated with the id.
            this is so that when we delete the element with that particular id, it will remove the entire row
        
        
        //- Replaced these code into a table
          for lead in leads
            //- span is to tell the browser to put the following body inline with the span body
            
            p(id=lead.id)
              span #{lead.email}

      //- LOOK AT THE BUTTON's FUNCTION. use `<javascript>` and '<pug variable>'

//- look at the condition: if leads mean if the webpage is rendering this page and puts a value into the key 'leads', then this condition is true and it
//- will render some things based on the command we have tasked it to do

//- on HTML/CSS/JS side: pug/JS are hierarchical in nature. if we delete the body corresponding to p(id=lead.id), we are effectively deleting all the
//-     child bodies that are nested inside of p body.
    
    Notice how we put header and footer at the top and body of the entire body
